# Clustering-in-Projective-Spaces
The aim was to construct a k-means algorithm for use in a projective space and then experiment with different ways of initialising it, in order to determine which of the proposed initialisations produces the most accurate clustering patterns. The department sought such a conclusion because they had recently come forward with a new method of independent component analysis which used clustering in a projective space as an intermediate stage. Though the project is complete, this repository is still very much a work in progress so a lot of the content has yet to be explained.
