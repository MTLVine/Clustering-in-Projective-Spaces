# Clustering-in-Projective-Spaces
Investigation in directional statistics conducted in the summer of 2019 as part of the University of Leeds School of Mathematics Undergraduate Bursary Scheme.  The aim was to construct a k-means algorithm for use in a projective space and then experiment with different ways of initialising it, in order to determine which of the proposed initialisations produces the most accurate clustering patterns. The department sought such a conclusion because they had recently come forward with a new method of independent component analysis which used clustering in a projective space as an intermediate stage.
